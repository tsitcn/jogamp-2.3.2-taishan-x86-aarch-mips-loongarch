    Fix JLS Binary Compat: Moving methods and fields upwards for classes _and_ interfaces is OK
    
    - We shall also travers all interfaces upwards
    - All methods and fields found upwards must be tested for compatibility as well!
    
    Further:
    - Add class-name to Field- and MethodInfo via new intermediate AbstractMemberInfo.
      The class-name is used to have allow differs to find a class move upwards!
    
    - Pretty printing of class move binary-compatible change
